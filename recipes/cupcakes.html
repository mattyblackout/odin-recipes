    <p>Who doesnt love cupcakes and rainbows? Well why not combine them with these delicious rainbow cupcakes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 sticks unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups cake flour</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 ounces sour cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 heaping cup of freeze-dried strawberries, crushed</li>
        <li>buttercream (See my lemon cupcakes and frosting recipe from Peach's 4th birthday or my carrot pineapple cupcakes cream cheese frosting recipe, if you don't already have a favorite.)</li>
        <li>rainbow belt candy, cut into 24 pieces (each piece is about 3 inches long)</li>
        <li>blue icing: powdered sugar + just enough milk to desired consistency + dribble of vanilla + dab of Wilton blue coloring gel</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.*</li>
        <li>Line 24-well muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
        <li>Beat sugars and butter together, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well between eggs. Beat in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Whisk and sift together flour and salt. Set aside. In another bowl, combine sour cream and baking soda.</li>
        <li>Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture in three additions, alternating with sour cream mixture and starting and ending with the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed freeze-dried strawberries.</li>
        <li>Fill each cupcake well about ⅔ full of batter. (I actually came out with 27 cupcakes.)</li>
        <li>Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean. (The timing will partly depend on your desire for puffy versus flat-topped cupcakes.)</li>
        <li>Cool in pans for a few minutes, until able to be handled without burning your fingers, and transfer to rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>How to decorate: Snip rainbow belts into about 3-inch pieces to create the rainbow that will sit atop the cupcake. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the blue icing: mix powdered sugar (I used about 1½ cups) and a couple tablespoons of milk and dribble of vanilla with a electric hand-held mixer to make smooth. If you want more runny icing, add more milk. Mix blue gel coloring in well.</li>
        <li>Dip each cupcake top into the blue icing and set aside.</li>
        <li>Using buttercream in a piping bag, pipe two small rosettes on top of the iced cupcake to make "clouds" on top of the cupcake.</li>
        <li>Add the rainbow by placing each end of the rainbow belt candy into a cloud. You might need to shove the candy into the cupcake a little to keep it upright. Pipe a little more frosting to make the clouds look more puffy, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
